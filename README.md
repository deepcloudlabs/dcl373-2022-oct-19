Installation Information:
========================================
For the installation of the working environment required for lab studies in education, you first need to download the compressed file in the link below to your machine:
https://courseware.deepcloudlabs.com/software/DEVEL-stage-2022a-java.se.and.spring.zip

After unzipping the compressed file to the **C:\\** directory, the directory structure will be as shown below:

![Installation folder](DEVEL-stage.png?raw=true "C: drive after decompress DEVEL-stage-2022a-java.se.and.spring.zip")

Check the directory structure on your disk against the one above. In case your **C:** drive is full, you can unzip the compressed file to a different drive. However, in this case you will need to modify a few configuration files. Please ask your instructor about these changes during the training.
